# Fake-News-Detector
This is a Fake News Detector developed using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. The project uses Logistic Regression and Random Forest algorithms to classify news headlines as fake or real. The Logistic Regression model achieved a high accuracy of 94%. We also built an interactive user interface with Streamlit to showcase the model's functionality.
